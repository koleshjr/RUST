Rust is a statically typed language
    there are two data types: scalar and compund
    let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number")

Scalar types: represents a single value
    include: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans and characters
    length    signed  unsigned
    8-bit       i8      u8
    16-bit      i16     u16
    32-bit      i32     u32
    64-bit      i64     u64
    128-bit     i128    u128
    arch        isize   usize

    signed numbers are stored using two complement representation: 2^n-1 to 2^n-1 - 1 e.g i8 = 128 - 127
    unsigned numbers 0 to 2^n-1 u8 0 -255
    Examples: decimal = 98_222
                hex = 0xff
                octal = 0o77
                binary = ob1111_0000
                byte = b'A'
